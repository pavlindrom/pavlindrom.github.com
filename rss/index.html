When I’ve found out about graph databases, I was ecstatic that now I can model my application’s data intuitively. When I learned about Roslyn, I envisioned a future where the code would flag everything I needed to think about. After seeing demos of AWS Lambda, and hearing some anecdotes about the cost savings, I was all in with whatever small project I was to take on. Sitting in a conference room, and learning about Azure Service Fabric, I decided to give this thing a whirl as it will make everything better.</p>

<p>I have played with all of the above, and have come to the age-old conclusion that a framework, or a platform, is just a tool to build a product. A choice will result in different code, but the same user interface, broadly speaking. All software has areas to read from, write in, and click on.</p>

<p>The search for the greatest technology stack is useless. The aftermath of that realization is a new vision.</p>

<h3 id="buildingonsyntaxtrees">Building on Syntax Trees</h3>

<p>Source code is the description of a process targeted towards computers and developers. A machine will look at it as a syntax tree, and create an executable that will follow the recipe laid down. A developer will read the same code but create a mental model that is far richer, from which they form connections to other systems around it.</p>

<p>This is the attempt to encode all the understanding that developers have amassed through experience with a certain technology stack. The means of reaching that goal is to load the syntax trees into a graph database, allowing for plug-ins to connect any parts together as higher level concepts derived from it. A simple example is to take <code>public class MyClass</code>, and end up with the following:</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2017/04/SimpleTree.PNG" alt="Simple Tree"></p>

<p>As it turns out, there are a great deal of open source projects that turn source code into syntax trees. Here are some I’ve found in a matter of minutes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://roslyn.io">Roslyn</a> - the official compiler as a platform from Microsoft, supporting C# and Visual Basic.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser">Javaparser</a> - supports Java 1.8, so I assume that the older versions of Java will also work.</li>
<li><a href="https://astexplorer.net/">Javascript AST Explorer</a> - shows the syntax tree from many JavaScript parsers - who but JavaScript can have so many implementations?</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser">PHP-Parser</a> - another widely used language of the web, it merits inclusion simply due to existing.</li>
<li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~dedmedved/TSQL-AST-0.04/lib/TSQL/AST.pm">TSQL::AST</a> - an alpha release of a TSQL parser, an exciting hope of being able to parse logic contained within SQL queries.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is a rather good list of projects to begin exploring.</p>

<h3 id="connectingconcepts">Connecting Concepts</h3>

<p>Here are the higher level concepts that I believe every developer constructs as they read source code. In this section I will get fairly excited about the opportunities that I can think of, as you’ll see from the use cases. The hope is that this information will be useful in all development activities: comprehending, troubleshooting, and extending code.</p>

<h4 id="typemetadata">Type Metadata</h4>

<p>Object oriented programming (OOP) is standard practice in software development today. Languages also provide a lot of different flavors of code organization techniques - interfaces, abstract classes, inheritance, annotations, methods, access modifiers, etc. This step is simply the extraction of that information in a language-agnostic model. All that means is that the nodes be consistent across languages, meaning that a class be named a class, even if in a language it’s called a type (or maybe it’s the other way around).</p>

<p><strong>Use Case</strong>: A browser plugin-in that matches the classes and methods used to a project, and links to the implementation.</p>

<h4 id="usageinformation">Usage Information</h4>

<p>Software isn’t executed in a linear fashion. That is another benefit of OOP - that functionally related code is usually found together. This is just a little bit of a nuissance in troubleshooting: to find what code runs in a process, the developer jumps between methods, classes, and packages.</p>

<p>To compile this data all variables should be assigned a class. Then any method calls, and what parameters are passed in, need to be stored.</p>

<p><strong>Use Case</strong>: A view that allows for methods to be "expanded" inside other methods (with the exception of recursive methods).</p>

<h4 id="logicallydatadriven">Logically Data-Driven</h4>

<p>Within each method is the logic of the software, cleverly expressed in the constructs defined by each language. All that ingenuity, though, can be simplified into basic computer logic. An example would be to convert something innocent like <code>var result = someValue || someMethod();</code> into  </p>

<pre><code>var result = false;  
if (someValue) {  
  result = true;
}
else if (someMethod()) {  
  result = true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The end result is code that is easy to interpret, even if it’s more verbose.</p>

<p>Data is the counterpart to logic. In order to correctly understand any code, data needs to be traceable throughout it, from the point of ingestion to its output, be it a database or one of those reports without which no customer is happy. All we need from data is to know when a value is converted to another type, copied into another memory address, or referenced from other methods.</p>

<p><strong>Use Case</strong>: View the conditions that results in execution from some position A in code, and end at B, including loops.</p>

<h4 id="threadmanagement">Thread Management</h4>

<p>Programs are beginning to use the computer resources more efficiently by better use of threads. All the complex logic associated with thread management, be it asynchronous or parallel, needs be extracted from the source code.</p>

<p>Asynchronous code is letting execution continue while a request for an external resource (e.g. an AJAX request for data) is being processed. Once it’s fulfilled, execution will continue from a specific location, with the response passed in. As such, to model asynchronous code we need to know what line of code execution continues with, the line of code to be resumed at, and how the data is made available to it.</p>

<p>Parallel code is the request of more processing threads to run through a big set of data. What we need to know here is how threads are started, the data they are initialized with, and when they are joined back together. Data access should be modeled as well - whether that is done through a monitor, a lock, or directly.</p>

<p><strong>Use Case</strong>: An analyzer that reveals potential race conditions, and variables that are accessed in different threads without proper access management.</p>

<h4 id="interactivity">Interactivity</h4>

<p>Probably the most fantastic concept - as in, containing the stuff fantasies are made of - is extracting all the ways software can be interacted with. All the inputs and events that cause some computation to initiate. This includes the entry point into the executable, port listeners, file watchers, queue processors, etc.</p>

<p>Conversely, any instance where some software is using an external resource should be modeled as well. Here we mean just the trigger of the previous examples: running an executable, connecting to another machine, writing to a file, writing to a queue, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Use Case</strong>: Reveal the effective dependencies in a system by matching process interactions over external resources.</p>

<h4 id="moreusecases">More Use Cases</h4>

<p>This is quite an undertaking, I will be the first to acknowledge that. Here are some appetizers, some carrots to reach for as the project is underway. These are the more advanced use cases that I would love to see:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A nifty UI that displays how the data flows through the system, first at a high level, but with the ability to zoom in for the details.</p></li>
<li><p>The ability to see how code is referenced and used system-wide, and highlight dead code.</p></li>
<li><p>Deploy as serverless application, based on the information extracted in this project.</p></li>
<li><p>Reveal possible security flaws in code, such as query injection attacks.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, these are just the ones I could think of. Which ones would you have liked to have when starting out as a software developer? Which ones would you have liked to have access to when you last tried to familiarize yourself with a company’s framework? Which ones would you experiment with, had the data been available now?</p>

<h3 id="changetracking">Change Tracking</h3>

<p>The project wouldn’t be complete without augmenting the power of source control. Modeling changes appropriately, from the source code, and across all information extracted from it, will make it possible to see how the entire system has been changed in a pull request, or how it has evolved over all time.</p>

<p>Somewhat related is a module that tracks packages. The result is hard facts about how a package is used - the number of projects that use it, which classes are used most of the time, and which methods. That would equip the package writers with the knowledge necessary to focus on the areas that are most used.</p>

<p>Change tracking is difficult, for which reason it will not be addressed from the concept stage. It is essential, so it will be eventually developed.</p>

<h3 id="inconclusion">In Conclusion</h3>

<p>And there you have it: a database of computing from which a beginner can learn a language’s intricacies, a troubleshooter can work towards an appropriate solution faster, a new employee can learn the company’s framework, and an architect can address issues in their framework as the code evolves.</p>

<p>In the coming months I will further explore some of the ideas expressed here. In the mean time, let me know your thoughts below.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Running a Blog for (Almost) Nothing]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Blogging has many benefits, I hear.

I don't need to hear many to be sold - I need a low price tag. The blogging cost isn't in the time it takes to write an article, not even that half of that time is spent writing the first few sentences, it's for the machine that must stay up at all times for the visitor.</p>

<p>When you start a blog you agree to obey the unwritten rule of the internet - to never be unavailable. You are not the corner shop that bars the windows at precisely 8 PM, a sign even to the customer with the unexpected emergency. They'd have to seek you personally to buy your services. On the internet you are a content distributor that must be ready to service requests at all times, whether here or half a world away.</p>

<p>For a first blog I desired a simple solution so that I wouldn't give up before reaching the finish line. This is what I reckon to be the simplest solution to the problem I sought to solve.</p>

<h3 id="buildingblocks">Building Blocks</h3>

<p>I pieced this blog together from whatever I had lying around, and the things I had a prior knowledge of. This should not be followed as a recipe, but as inspiration.</p>

<h4 id="araspberrypi">A Raspberry Pi</h4>

<p>The first piece of the setup is a Raspberry Pi 3 I purchased a few months prior. I got it for someone else's school project, since they had no intention to hold onto such a thing after the assignment was over. You can't judge a designer for being a little too cool towards hardware, or for hating the LED blinker assignment.</p>

<p>I intend to host the website on the Pi locally, to set up the blog, write the articles, and fiddle with the design of the blog on it. It is more than sufficient to sustain the load of one user, once in a while. The files will then be stored and served cold to the world.</p>

<p>Setting up the Pi is <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/setup/">pretty simple</a>. Once you have it running, connect it to wifi, and then you can easily SSH to make any changes.</p>

<p>I suggest getting Avahi installed on the Pi - it lets me connect to the Pi using <code>{hostname}.local</code> just by running <code>sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon</code>, and having Apple's <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/167190/how-and-why-to-assign-the-.local-domain-to-your-raspberry-pi/">Bonjour software installed</a>. <em>Also, I'm glad I found about this before attempting to create a static IP, and learn of <a href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/39785/dhcpcd-vs-etc-network-interfaces">all the ways</a> it doesn't work <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=110557&amp;p=762332">just right</a> on the Pi</em>. I'd still like the 4 hours back, though.</p>

<h4 id="theghostpublishingplatform">The Ghost Publishing Platform</h4>

<p>I decided to use <a href="https://ghost.org/"><em>Ghost</em></a> to serve the content, simply because I heard about it before. Ghost is still in development, so it may not be the right solution for you. It is free if you host it yourself.</p>

<p>Ghost runs on node.js LTS, so make sure you have the right version installed - the latest version will probably give you trouble. The commands listed <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions">here</a> have worked for me.</p>

<p>Ghost has a <a href="http://support.ghost.org/getting-started/">getting started</a> guide. Make it <a href="https://www.ghostforbeginners.com/keep-ghost-running-with-pm2/">autostart with PM2</a>. Use <a href="http://support.ghost.org/basic-nginx-config/">Nginx to proxy</a> those pages to the internal network. Finally, update the Ghost URL in config.js to the internally accessible URL - otherwise the links will point to localhost.</p>

<h4 id="githubpages">GitHub Pages</h4>

<p>GitHub offers free static file hosting to anyone through their GitHub Pages. It is for open source projects, and your own personal websites. No merchandising. You get one just by creating a free account. It's easy to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/">get started</a>, and pretty easy to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/">use a custom domain</a> if you're so inclined. You will need to complement this update with some changes at the registrar, and Google should help with that.</p>

<h4 id="bitbucket">BitBucket</h4>

<p>Now onto another git repository, which I want to use for <a href="https://www.ghostforbeginners.com/backup-ghost/">backing up</a> the entire blog. I plan to create a backup everytime I publish something to GitHub Pages, and I want the backup to be private. <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> offers unlimited private repositories even on the free plan.</p>

<h3 id="alltogethernow">All Together Now</h3>

<p>The solution isn't yet complete. The website needs to be downloaded, pushed to GitHub Pages, and backed up to BitBucket. All these things are pretty easy on Linux. I never been so fond of Linux.</p>

<h4 id="makeastaticcopy">Make A Static Copy</h4>

<p>Linux has <code>wget</code> which downloads a file. With a few flags, I can make a copy of the website locally:  </p>

<pre><code>wget -rp --content-disposition http://{hostname}.local  
</code></pre>

<p>That will follow and download all links recursively (<code>-r</code>), all required resource, such as CSS and JavaScript files (<code>-p</code>), and save the Content-Disposition MIME type (<code>--content-disposition</code>) if they are on the domain <code>http://{hostname}.local</code>.</p>

<p>I hope that the Content-Disposition will be handled correctly, GitHub claims they <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/mime-types-on-github-pages/">support the feature</a>, with Nginx in the text on the page. I don't know how to test it, and it hasn't broken the page in browsing the website.</p>

<p>Once this command finishes, there is a folder <code>{hostname}.local</code> in the current directory (I decided to do it under <code>/var/www/ghost</code>).</p>

<h4 id="fixfilenames">Fix File Names</h4>

<p>Ghost requests CSS and JavaScript pages using a querystring version parameter to bust caches. They can be removed with:  </p>

<pre><code>find ./{hostname}.local -name '*\?*' -type f | while read -r name  
do  
    mv -i "$name" "${name%\?*}"
done  
</code></pre>

<h4 id="makelinksrelative">Make Links Relative</h4>

<p>Some links are also pointing to <code>http://{hostname}.local</code>, which is only accessible from the local network. Changing all links to be relative will allow me to host it anywhere I please. Here's how:  </p>

<pre><code>find ./{hostname}.local -type f -exec sed -i 's/http:\/\/{hostname}\.local\/\?/\//g' {} +  
</code></pre>

<p>You can easily change it to a custom domain instead of relative links. There may be a reason to do that, and I don't know it.</p>

<h4 id="publishblog">Publish Blog</h4>

<p>Now that the files are correctly formatted, and linked, we can publish. The first step is to copy the static pages into the local GitHub Pages repository, then delete (outright move didn't work, for unknown reasons):  </p>

<pre><code>cp -r ./{hostname}.local/* /usr/src/{username}.github.com  
rm -rf ./{hostname}.local  
</code></pre>

<p>Then commit the changes:  </p>

<pre><code>cd /usr/src/{username}.github.com  
git add -A  
git commit -m"Blog publish"  
git push  
</code></pre>

<p>A great side effect about this is that no links will ever be broken. The other side of the coin is that when URLs change formats, there is no easy way to redirect from the old to the new.</p>

<h4 id="backup">Backup</h4>

<p>For backing up it is recommended that the blog is stopped to avoid database corruption. This is pretty straight forward:  </p>

<pre><code>cd /var/www/ghost  
pm2 stop ghost  
git add -A  
git commit -m"Backup on publish"  
git push  
pm2 start ghost  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>That is it. The setup has its challenges, and it has been a good source of confusion as I worked through it. I could not detail all the things that I have come across as I worked, primarily because I haven't kept a list, but also since all the solutions to the problems are easy to find with Google, or a comparable web search engine.</p>

<p>The script to take the website from the local host to the internet is then straightforward. I have modified it one bit - instead of using a generic commit message (it doesn't look in the log), I'm able to send a custom commit message to the script. And that's a significant improvement.</p>

<p>Speaking of the script, here it is, ready for you to replace <code>{hostname}</code> and <code>{username}</code> with the correct values, and use to share your insights with the world at large:  </p>

<pre><code># Create static copy
wget -rp --content-disposition http://{hostname}.local

# Fix file names
find ./{hostname}.local -name '*\?*' -type f | while read -r name  
do  
    mv -i "$name" "${name%\?*}"
done

# Update URLs
find ./{hostname}.local -type f -exec sed -i 's/http:\/\/{hostname}\.local\/\?/\//g' {} +

# Publish blog
cp -r ./{hostname}.local/* /usr/src/{username}.github.com  
rm -rf ./{hostname}.local  
cd /usr/src/{username}.github.com  
git add -A  
git commit -m"$1"  
git push

# Backup entire blog
cd /var/www/ghost  
runuser -l pi -c 'pm2 stop ghost'  
git add -A  
git commit -m"$1"  
git push  
runuser -l pi -c 'pm2 start ghost'  
</code></pre>

<p>The final step is to make the file executable with <code>sudo chmod +x ./publish.sh</code>. Now you can run it as <code>sudo sh ./publish.sh "Commit message"</code>.</p>

<p>I haven't grasped permissions in Linux yet, and sudo still solves all my problems - except where it doesn't. In the above script I am switching the user back from <code>root</code> to <code>pi</code> (or whatever other user you have created for the purpose of running ghost), since pm2 doesn't find the requested process if it's running as root. The quick and dirty solution isn't pretty, but it's a solution. </p>

<h4 id="advantages">Advantages</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cost</strong>: hosting is free. The only thing I pay for is the domain.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: without a password-protected area, I don't have to worry about someone gaining access to the admin portal and defacing the website.</li>
<li><strong>Change Tracking</strong>: I mean, isn't it great that I can say I updated this blog post, and have a <a href="https://github.com/pavlindrom/pavlindrom.github.com/compare/41021356d4d59eae67e1f2a6eaba4080b7ca41e5...7d8f068010f816a32fca2c1f07a37f3276d05619#diff-7c183389497d70d9653a227b3e71e7eb">link that shows all changes</a>? Yes, it is. Thanks, GitHub Pages.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Added Complexity</strong>: it's not an update it and forget it workflow. After every update I need to remember to publish.</li>
<li><strong>No Travelling Allowed</strong>: I can't update the blog from anywhere, I need to be able to access the home network for every update. Urgent fixes can be made by editing the HTML, but the same change must be made in ghost admin once I return home.</li>
<li><strong>No Secure Connection</strong>: By using GitHub Pages with a custom domain I don't have SSL/TLS to secure the data in passing. Not a huge issue since there are no password-protected areas, but it's still not desirable.</li>
<li><strong>No Dynamic Content</strong>: Since I'm saving a static copy of the website I can't rely on endpoints to receive data. I'd have to use Amazon's Lambdas, or Azure's Functions (which I wouldn't mind playing with).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="lookingforward">Looking Forward</h4>

<p>There are a number of things that can be improved, and the biggest that I can see is the need to <code>sudo</code> everything, except where I can't, so I need to <em>unsudo</em> for a few lines. </p>

<p>I'm also thinking of eventually moving the hosting to Amazon S3. That way I will be able to get a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/pricing/">free SSL certificate</a>, and the cost of hosting a static website should stay low - at a few cents a month.</p>

<h3 id="finalremarks">Final Remarks</h3>

<p><img src="/content/images/2017/01/WP_20170108_14_21_58_Pro.jpg" alt="Wing it."></p>

<p>I winged it - and so can you. With just one blog post under my wings I can tell you that there's a great reason to start blogging - to learn how much more there is to learn.</p>

<p>And, if at any time you have shaken your head at my setup - let me know in the comments area. All others with opinions on the topic, feel free to do the same.</p>
